# 5.03.2021
- Change the project name to RPGSlash from RPGSlasher


# 4.03.2021
- New Origin: Feline
- New Classes: Magician, Dwarf, Farmer
- Reworked Fabric Furances recipes, removed useless progression (Vanilla->Iron->Diamond->Obsidian->End->Ethereal) + made them require a bit more grind
- Pescatarian -> New power type, people in this can only eat sea food (+ added Go Fish fishes to it)
- Removed fish from origins:meat tag, instead added origins:pescatarian tag
- Example command with KubeJS, need to change it into something better later on
- New beacon payment items: Cincinnasite Ingot, Thallasium Ingot, Amber Gem, Ender Pearl, Nether Ruby, Anthracite, Lignite, Lapis Lazuli
- Implement test loot crate with test loot table
- Change up stuff in ``identity.json5`` so it doesn't endlessly show the user a message that they got a identity applied on them (Feline)


# 2.03.2021
- Added recipes for Blaze Rods, Shulker Shells, Vanilla Hammers etc.
- Two new origins: Enderling, Loot Goblin
- Modified BattleTowers loot tables
- Modified Dungeons of Exile loot tables
- Modified Village loot tables (actually forgot to do this, will do it later on)
- Modify Chat Tabs to have seperated messages for Server Announcements, Trading Chat, Direct Messages (/msg), Global (Main), Advancements, Challenges
- Change Window Title to ``title=RPGSlasher - WIP 0.0A | MC Version 1.16.5``
- Add Loot Crate upcrafting (from T0 - Common to T1 - Uncommon up to Relic)
- Add AoE Dust upcrafting (ditto)
- Tried to make DoE items unflamable but apparently another mod/or API call makes the Fire Golem entity always drop a silver key which would essentially result in extra key after defeating a battletower

# 28.02.2021
- Start the work on the modpack, using AdventurePack 4.3.1 as base
- Deleted lots of mods, added new ones primarly the ones I can recall on top of my head are Reroll from Drayal and other stuff
